* Date2name
  
Date2name is an Emacs package inspired by [[https://github.com/novoid/date2name][date2name]] by [[https://github.com/novoid/][novoid]]. It can add ISO-Timestamps to files in dired.

** Installation
Clone this git repository and load =date2name.el=.

** Usage

In dired call =date2name-dired-add-date-to-name= to add the modification date of the file to the filename. With the prefix *C-u* the user is instead prompted to insert a date using the wonderful org-read-date.
The same is true for =filetags-dired-add-datetime-to-name= only that it also adds the time.
The format is again the same as in [[https://github.com/novoid/date2name][date2name]] of novoid.

Unfortunately right now this format should not be changed as it must match a corresponding regexp to remove potential timestamps already in the filename.
